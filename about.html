              <h2>Objectives</h2>
            
            <p>The main objective of the "BIO-NET" project is to offer advice and support to organisations that are interested in EU-funded research projects in the Knowledge Based Bio-Economy thematic priority of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7).</p>
            <p>Our support aims to help improve the quality of research project proposals submitted in the KBBE theme of FP7 and to lower the barriers for newcomers, in particular young researchers and SMEs.</p>
            <p> The BIO-NET network of National Contact Points assists interested parties by providing information and tailor-made training sessions. It also offers support in consortium building by locating suitable project partners and organising matchmaking events.</p>
            <p>Finally, BIO-NET aims to improve the quality of NCP services throughout Europe by exchange of best practices, experience and common tools.</p>
             
            
            <h2>Activities</h2>
            
            <p>Access to FP7 KBBE calls will be simplified by a series of 10 cross-border workshops, aimed specifically at SMEs, lowering the barriers for participation. A similar series will be focussed on young researchers, making it easier for them to participate.</p>
            <p>Both types of workshops will provide tailor made information on proposal writing, consortium building, identification and involvement of SMEs, financial and legal issues, etc.</p>
            <p>A series of 4 real brokerage events and several virtual ones, together with the establishment of a high quality database with profiles, will create the basis for efficient matchmaking between interested parties from industry and academia. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h2>Services offered</h2>
    <p>
                The BIO-NET project offers the full support that National Contact Points in the KBBE area can provide. The network website is a gateway to individual national services. Apart from those there are specific services provided by the network, covering the entire life-cycle of an FP7 project from project idea conception to matchmaking and consortium building to submission of the proposal and the negotiation phase.
